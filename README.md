# Generate Emoji sprite sheets for Telegram Desktop

## About
These are my scripts to generate emoji sprite sheets for [Telegram Desktop](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop),
particularly with the [Noto Color Emoji](https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji) intended for use
with the [telegram-desktop-systemqt-notoemoji](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/telegram-desktop-systemqt-notoemoji)
AUR package which I maintain.

## Build Instructions

### I. Prerequisites
* python3 (for my scripts)
* python2 (for Google's Noto tools)
* imagemagick (for tiling and converting the images)
* all of Telegrams build dependencies

### I. Get the emoji codepoint list from Telegram.
Rather than using actual fonts, Telegram stores emoji as spritemaps (based on the Apple emoji) in
a set of five webp files located in `tdesktop/Telegram/Resources/emoji`. The tricky first step was
figuring out the proper order of emoji that Telegram expects.

1. Clone the `tdesktop` source code
2. Apply `generator.cpp.patch` from this repo
3. Use `gyp` and `cmake` to set up Makefiles (the details of this step are left as an exercise for
   the reader)
4. cd to `tdesktop/out/Release` and run `make codegen_emoji`
5. run `./codegen_emoji >emojilist.txt` and copy `emojilist.txt` to this repo
   1. This creates a file that contains one emoji per line

### II. Get and prepare the Noto Color Emoji
1. Clone noto-emoji and nototools into this directory
```
git clone https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji
git clone https://github.com/googlei18n/nototools noto-emoji/nototools
```
2. Apply `collect_emoji.patch` to the noto-emoji directory.
3. Run `collect_emoji_svg.py` in the noto-emoji directory
```
cd noto-emoji
PYTHONPATH=$PWD/nototools python2 collect_emoji_svg.py out -f third_party/region-flags/svg -e svg
cd ..
```
This will collect all the SVG emoji and flag files into a single `noto-emoji/out` directory.

### III. Build the sprite sheets
This step's easy:
```
./gen-emoji-grid.py
```

### IV. Build Telegram Desktop with the new emoji
1. Go back to your tdesktop source and clean it
2. Copy the webp files from `telegram-noto-emoji` into `tdesktop/Telegram/Resources/emoji`
   (overwrite the existing files)
3. Compile tdesktop as usual.

* k3a's [telegram-emoji-list](https://github.com/k3a/telegram-emoji-list) repository which helped me
  find the right place to extract the emoji codepoint order
* [PeterCxy](https://github.com/PeterCxy) for making the original
  `telegram-desktop-systemqt-notoemoji` AUR package before I adopted it.
* OriginCode on the AUR site for pointing out to me that Telegram recently refactored their emoji
  code, spuring me to figure all this out and update it.
